<img src="ae098c7d.gif" alt="">
<p class="BodyText">Prescription/validation rights allow you to control 
who can add and document different items on a patient chart. These rights 
reflect the needs of different types of users and hospital policies 
and procedures. Rights are assigned to treatments and standard orders.</p>

<p class="BodyText">Rights are also assigned to user groups. Users in 
a group can work with all database items that share the same prescription/validation 
rights. Users only see the items to which they have access when ordering. 
This allows you to limit access to items and filter them so that specialists 
see only the ones that they need.</p>

<p class="BodyText">For example, to allow only doctors to add any standard 
narcotic order to a patient chart but allow both doctors and nurses 
to document its administration, the following rights structure could 
be used:</p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5></span> 
A prescription/validation right called &#147;Narcotics, order&#148; 
and another called &#147;Narcotics, document.&#148;</p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5></span> 
Standard orders for all narcotics with the Order Access set to &#147;Narcotics, 
order&#148; and the Validation Access set to &#147;Narcotics, document.&#148; 
</p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5></span> 
A user group called &#147;Doctors&#148; with the prescription/validation 
right &#147;Narcotics, order.&#148; All doctors are members of this 
user group.</p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5></span> 
A user group called &#147;Nurses&#148; with the prescription/validation 
right &#147;Narcotics, document.&#148; All nurses are members of this 
user group.</p>

<p class="BodyText">CareSuite includes a set of default rights. Custom 
rights are created in the priming phase and assigned to treatments and 
standard orders before the database is generated. New rights can be 
added to an installed database using DB&#160;Editor.</p>
