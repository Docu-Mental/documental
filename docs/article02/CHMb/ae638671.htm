<p class="BodyText">Anesthesia and PACU Manager users typically need 
to document who performed certain key functions in a case. The Attending 
Type classifies staff members by their medical specialties. An staff 
member with a particular Attending Type can play different roles in 
a specific procedures. For example, a surgeon might fill any of the 
following roles: Primary Surgeon, Scheduled Surgeon, Surgical Resident. 
In CareSuite, these are known as Clinical Roles. </p>

<p class="BodyText">If your hospital does not use OR Manager, you can 
perform the following tasks using DB Editor:</p>

<p class="BodyText"><a class="BodyText"
 href="ae705687.htm#Rae45553">Create a new clinical role</a></p>

<p class="BodyText"><a class="BodyText"
 href="ae705692.htm#Rae39431">Modify the attending types associated 
with a clinical role</a></p>

<p class="BodyText"><a class="BodyText"
 href="ae705744.htm#Rae40775">Delete a clinical role</a></p>

<p class="BodyText">If your system is configured for perioperative integration 
with OR Manager, you will create and delete clinical roles using Picis 
Security Manager. You can modify the attending types associated with 
a role in DB Editor.</p>
