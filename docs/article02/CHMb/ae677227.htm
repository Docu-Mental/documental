<p class="BodyText">DB&#160;Editor allows you to work with patient locations 
and hospital departments. Locations are entries in the database that 
correspond to rooms or beds for patients and CareSuite workstations. 
Each workstation and patient location is associated with a department. 
Hospital departments were created during the priming phase. </p>

<p class="BodyText">Entries for bedside and multibed workstations are 
added to the LOCATIONS table in the database automatically during software 
setup. There are three types of locations:</p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5></span> 
A bedside workstation is both a workstation and a patient location. 
The workstation can be used to admit only to this location.</p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5></span> 
A multibed workstation is a workstation but not a patient locations; 
multibed workstations allow caregivers to work with multiple patients 
who are admitted to multibed locations.</p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5></span> 
A multibed patient location is a patient location without a workstation. 
Users select a patient location when admitting a patient in a multibed 
unit.</p>

<p class="BodyText">After implementation, you can use DB&#160;Editor 
to enter patient locations for multibed workstations, and modify and 
delete items.</p>
