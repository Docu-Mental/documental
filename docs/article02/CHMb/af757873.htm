<p class="BodyText"><a
 name="Xaf757874"></a>The Auxiliary tables section provides access to 
certain database tables for working with their content. All of these 
tables were populated using the Priming Tool before installation of 
the software, or by sending test data from other information systems 
during implementation. DB&#160;Editor lets you add new items, edit existing 
ones, and, some cases, disable unneeded items. </p>

<p class="BodyText">Tables with an <span class="CommandClass">Index</span> 
column allow you to control the order in which items appear in the application. 
Items appear in ascending order of their index value. (To set the sort 
order for laboratory items, <span class="EmphasisClass">see</span> <a class="BodyText"
 href="af645775.htm#Raf68040">Sort order for analyses and components</a>.)</p>

<p class="BodyText">If some items in a table are indexed and others 
not, the manner in which items appear in the application differs between 
Preop Manager on the one hand and Anesthesia, PACU and Critical Care 
Manager on the other. In Preop Manager, items that are not indexed are 
shown alphabetically at the top of windows and the indexed items are 
shown below. By contrast, in Anesthesia Manager (etc) indexed items 
are shown at the top of windows and the non-indexed items are shown 
below.</p>
