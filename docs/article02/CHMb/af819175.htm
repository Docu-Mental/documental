<p class="BodyText">The recommendation will be shown at the bottom of 
a form if the combined score for all risk factors (sections) on that 
form falls within the configured range. </p>

<p class="BodyText">Note that a recommendation applies to all risk assessments 
having the relevant score. To create an individual recommendation for 
each risk assessment, you must make sure the score for each risk factor 
is such that the combined score can only possibly apply to the assessment 
in question. For example, suppose you have two assessments, each with 
four risk factors: you give a score of 1 to each risk factor in the 
first assessment, giving a possible total score of 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4; 
you give a score of 10 to each risk factor in the second assessment, 
giving a possible total score of 0, 10, 20, 30 or 40. (The only score 
that can never be unique is 0.)</p>
