<p class="BodyText">Two types of access rights exist in CareSuite:</p>

<p class="BodyText">Rights associated with application functionality 
are called system rights and are part of the software; you cannot create 
new system rights or delete existing ones. </p>

<p class="BodyText">Rights associated with clinical content are called 
Prescription/Validation rights. A group of predefined rights are provided 
with CareSuite; you can create new rights using DB Editor. As their 
name implies, these rights control access to treatments and orders in 
the database. </p>

<p class="BodyText">Each treatment and order in the database has two 
prescription/validation rights associated with it: </p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5></span> 
One for prescribing (adding one or more scheduled tasks to the patient 
chart) </p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5></span> 
One for documenting completion of a task related to the order </p>

<p class="BodyText">You can use Prescription/Validation rights in two 
ways:</p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5></span> 
To limit access to treatments in order to prevent some users from being 
able to work with them.</p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5></span> 
To associate specific treatments with certain types of clinicians in 
order to hide all other treatments for these clinicians.</p>
