 name="Xaa498698"></a></span> Perioperative integration: Anesthesia 
Manager, PACU Manager, Preop Manager and OR&#160;Manager share patient 
common data elements so that data entered in one application appears 
in other applications.</p>

<p class="BulletedNoBullet">For more information, see the <span class="EmphasisClass">Workstation 
User&#146;s Guide</span>.</p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5></span> 
New type of workstation: In addition to the bedside workstation, a new 
type of workstation now exists&#151;the <span class="EmphasisClass">multibed</span> 
workstation. Multibed workstations are not associated with specific 
patient locations, but instead allow users full access to a group of 
patients in a department. </p>

<p class="BulletedNoBullet">This type of workstation is appropriate 
for low-acuity recovery units, and clinician work and lounge areas. 
Users at these workstations can typically view and document data for 
all patients that are listed in the Census window. The bedside workstation 
type continues to be appropriate for patients in operating rooms and 
other high-acuity areas. </p>

<p class="BulletedNoBullet">The workstation type is selected during 
installation. After installation, you will need to create an entry for 
each bed in the units served by multibed workstations.</p>

<p class="Bulleted"><font face="Wingdings" font size=1><span class="BulletFontClass">l</font><img src="1p.gif" width=5><a
 name="Xaa503548"></a></span> Access Type: This workstation setting 
determines what kind of access users have to remote patients. View/Chart 
allows charting; View-only allows viewing but no charting. Multibed 
workstations with View/Chart access replace Visual&#160;Care. This configuration 
is designed for doctors&#146; lounges or ICU rounds rooms where remote 
charting and order entry are needed. Multibed workstations with View-only 
access may be situated at the front desk of an operating room department 
for viewing data for patients in different operation rooms. Bedside 
workstations with View/Chart access replace Remote&#160;View. </p>

<p class="BulletedNoBullet">You configure a workstation&#146;s access 
type (View/Chart or View&#160;only) using Customize.</p>
