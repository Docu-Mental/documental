<p class="BodyText"><a

 name="Xab1028576"></a>The term <span class="EmphasisClass">real-time 
variable</span> in CareSuite refers to device-related and other physiologic 
parameters that appear on the standard flowsheet Real-Time Variables. 
Data is typically supplied by devices connected to the workstation. 
If not supplied by a device, data for a parameter can be entered manually. 
Heart Rate, for example, is typically supplied by a device while Patient 
Weight is entered manually. The Real-Time Variables flowsheet can contain 
up to 992 variables. Six variables from the flowsheet can appear on 
the optional Vital Signs bar. </p>

<p class="BodyText">Derived variables are real-time variables that obtain 
their data from calculations performed on data for other real-time variables. 
Calculations may use constants from the database or data from devices. 
You cannot enter data manually for these variables.</p>

<p class="BodyText"><a
 name="Xab330646"></a>Real-time variables are sometimes also used for 
<a
 name="Xab633492"></a>laboratory parameters, particularly items that 
are analyzed at the bedside, such as glucose and arterial blood gases. 
Picis recommends using real-time variables for laboratory data that 
will be entered manually by caregivers. (Laboratory components, the 
other type of laboratory data, are designed for use with a link to the 
laboratory system.)</p>

<p class="BodyText">Note that data from infusion pumps connected to 
the workstation is displayed with other fluid intake data.</p>
