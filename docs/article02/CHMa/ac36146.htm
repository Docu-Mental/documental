<p class="BodyText">Determines the frequency with which the workstation 
automatically retrieves data from the main database.</p>

<p class="BodyText">The local workstation stores certain database tables 
in local memory after retrieving them from the main database the first 
time they are needed. New information in the main database is detected 
using PIMS, so that it can subsequently be retrieved by the workstation. 
In addition, the workstation automatically retrieves new information 
from time to time in case there is a problem with PIMS. The CacheRefreshProbability 
parameter determines how often this occurs. </p>

<p class="BodyText">The parameter is expressed as the ratio of queries 
to data retrievals. With the highest possible ratio, 1:1, the workstation 
retrieves new data from the main database every time the application 
needs data. With the default ratio of 1:0.0001, the workstation retrieves 
new data from the main database once for every 10000 queries.</p>

<p class="BodyText">This setting has little effect on performance under 
normal conditions because the system communicates changes to the content 
of the main database to local workstations immediately.</p>

<p class="HeadingValues">Sample Values</p>

<p class="BodyText">1 = Data refreshed once for every query (recommended 
setting when working with DB&#160;Editor)</p>

<p class="BodyText">0.1 = Data refreshed once for every 10 queries </p>

<p class="BodyText">0.0001 = Data refreshed once for every 10000 queries 
(recommended setting for normal use)</p>
