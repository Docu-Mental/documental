documented together during surgery. They are often used in operating 
room templates to document surgical milestones that are required for 
all patients, such as <span class="EmphasisClass">Start of anesthesia</span>. 
Users can add an event set to the patient chart by choosing it in the 
Add Events window or running a macro.</p>

<p class="BodyText">You create event sets and event macros in the Event 
Sets and Macros window. Event sets and macros are independent of the 
template; once created, they can be included in any template. <a class="BodyText"
 href="ab586622.htm#Rab38179">Configure a macro as an add-in</a>.</p>

<p class="BodyText">The process for creating an event macro is the same 
as for creating an event set. You can configure a macro to perform an 
action, such as executing a menu command or applying a screen layout, 
after adding the events. And you can configure a macro as an add-in 
with a button on the Macrobar.</p>

<p class="BodyText">Note: if a supervisor event is included in an event 
set, it will only be added to the Events Log if the event set is added 
to the patient chart by a user with the &#147;Sam View and Use&#148; 
system right.</p>
