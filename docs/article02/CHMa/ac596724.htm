<p class="BodyText">Workstation settings determine aspects of application 
behavior that are identical for every session, independent of the template 
used. Although Customize provides access to over 1000 configuration 
parameters, this help only provides information about the ones you are 
likely to need in normal use. If you have questions about other parameters, 
contact your Picis representative. </p>

<p class="BodyText">Besides the configuration of Anesthesia Manager, 
PACU Manager and Critical Care Manager, this section of the help also 
describes the configuration of <a
 name="Xac596706"></a>Preop Manager, which does not use templates. </p>

<p class="BodyText">To start Customize, <span class="EmphasisClass">see</span> 
<a class="BodyText"
 href="ab761719.htm#Rab18494">Starting and Quitting Customize</a>. Follow 
the instructions to start the application and then click <span class="CommandClass">Open</span> 
with any template highlighted. Note that although you must open a template 
to set workstation parameters, these settings are not stored in the 
template itself. They affect the behavior of the system regardless of 
which template was open during configuration and which template a user 
chooses for a session.</p>
