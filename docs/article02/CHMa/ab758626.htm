<p class="BodyText"><a

 name="Xab945004"></a>A session represents the period of time that a 
patient is admitted to a CareSuite location. A location could be an 
operating room or a bed in an ICU or PACU. One or more consecutive sessions 
(typically in different beds or rooms) in a department or care area 
constitutes an encounter. The patient&#146;s CareSuite record contains 
data from all encounters in the admission.</p>

<p class="BodyText">The system considers two sessions to be part of 
the same encounter when the templates used share the same encounter 
type. Templates for induction, intraoperative and postoperative care 
units might have an encounter type called <span class="EmphasisClass">Perioperative</span>. 
Templates for different intensive care units (CVICU, SICU, MICU, PICU 
and NICU) might share one called <span class="EmphasisClass">Critical 
Care</span>. Each hospital creates and names the encounter types it 
needs.</p>

<p class="BodyText"><a
 name="Xab944997"></a>The time bar displays the encounter type and template 
name for each session to identify the clinical environment that corresponds 
to the data. Users can select an entire encounter when viewing fluid 
balance demographic data, and when creating printouts. </p>

<p class="BodyText">Encounter types have a property that classifies 
them as ICU-related or not ICU-related. This property affects two aspects 
of the application:</p>

<p class="BodyText"><a
 name="Xab945595"></a>The Common Choice lists that contain the most 
commonly used diagnoses, procedures, medications and allergies for quick 
selection. CareSuite includes lists for perioperative, critical care 
and preoperative data. (You can edit lists with DB&#160;Editor.)</p>

<p class="BodyText"><a
 name="Xab945603"></a>The encounter type also determines whether data 
collected during an encounter can be used to calculate the APACHE II 
score. This score requires data from the first 24 hours of a patient's 
stay in an intensive care unit. The score can only be calculated using 
data collected with a template classified as ICU-related; data collected 
with a non-ICU template during a session in an ICU cannot be used. Note: 
If there is no patient admitted to a workstation, there will be no active 
template. For actions that may be performed while there is no patient, 
such as exiting the application, the template used is that which was 
used for the previously admitted patient.</p>
