These files are images showing the documentation sub-portals available for each type of client package. Each rectangle inside an orange or green section is a sub-portal created from its own Confluence wiki space using the K15t Scroll addin. Versioning is available for each wiki space (no need to consult the Page History like you would do in native Confluence). Content from each sub-portal is conditional depending on the type of client package.
